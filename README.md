# Dynamic-hash-and-project

Project consist of two applications. 
First - implemented data structure Dynamic hashing. Dynamic hashing is a table implementation in file system. Data are stored in binary form. Structure uses TRIE as index. TRIE expands/shrinks itself as the data grows or reduce. TRIE consists of two type of nodes, internal and external. Internal olny points to parent and children. External is always leaf node and consist of number of record and file address (or index) to data. Data records are stored in file in blocks. Block can consists of several records, however each block must have same amount of records. There is not such thing as deleted record, there is just correct or incorrect record (for preserving equal size). Hash collisions are solved by block chaining (each block has address (index) of other block with records with same hash). Size of file increases when new block is created at the end of file and decreases similar way. File size can be reduce only by deleting block at the end of file, not in the middle. If there is a block with all incorrect records, it is stored and used once there is a need to store data in new block. 
Second - just an easy application to show the implementation of structure.
